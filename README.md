# maadi-international-choir
This is my student project. It is a website for a community choir. 

This project is in progress. The homepage design is finalized.

### Elements to work on:

* adjust CSS design around % (not px, as it is currently) to suit different browser sizes
* build the navigation links (About, Gallery, Listen, Watch, Past Seasons)
* what is the best method to organize CSS files for multiple pages (nav links, above)? Does each of the 5 HTML files need its own CSS or is there a way to link them to a single style sheet?
